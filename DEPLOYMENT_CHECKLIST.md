## üîç Health Checks

### Daily Checks
```bash
# 1. Check data freshness
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT MAX(fetched_at) as last_update 
FROM fda_data.fda_drug_adverse_events
"

# 2. Check record count
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records 
FROM fda_data.fda_drug_adverse_events
"

# 3. Check app is running
curl -I http://localhost:8501
```

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review BigQuery usage and costs
- [ ] Check Translation API usage (if enabled)
- [ ] Check Speech API usage (if enabled)
- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Test all major features
- [ ] Verify data sync is working

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

### App Won't Start
- [ ] Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.8+)
- [ ] Verify all packages installed: `pip list | grep -E "streamlit|pandas|google-cloud"`
- [ ] Check for syntax errors: `python -m py_compile app_final_v2.py`
- [ ] Review error messages in console

### Can't Connect to BigQuery
- [ ] Verify project ID is correct
- [ ] Check authentication: `gcloud auth list`
- [ ] Verify service account has permissions
- [ ] Test direct BigQuery access: `bq ls fda_data`
- [ ] Check for typos in dataset/table names

### No Data Showing
- [ ] Confirm table has data: `bq query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fda_data.fda_drug_adverse_events"`
- [ ] Check data format in sample rows
- [ ] Verify drug_names and reactions fields are populated
- [ ] Review query logs for errors

### Search Returns No Results
- [ ] Go to Data Explorer to see available data
- [ ] Try simpler search terms (single words)
- [ ] Check spelling
- [ ] Verify search term exists in Data Explorer lists

### Charts Not Rendering
- [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify Plotly version: `pip show plotly`
- [ ] Try different browser
- [ ] Check if query returned data

### Permission Errors
- [ ] Wait 60 seconds for IAM changes to propagate
- [ ] Re-run permission grant commands
- [ ] Check service account is correct
- [ ] Verify all required APIs are enabled
